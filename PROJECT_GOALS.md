# Task Manager CLI - Project Goals

Build a fully-featured command-line task manager with persistence, priorities, filtering, and comprehensive testing.

## Objective

Create a production-ready CLI tool that demonstrates the autonomous agent's ability to:
- Build clean, modular architecture
- Implement CRUD operations
- Handle file I/O and data persistence
- Write comprehensive tests
- **Learn patterns across similar tasks** (memory system validation)

---

## Phase 1: Core Functionality

### Task 1: Project Setup & Basic Commands
- [x] Create src/task.js with CLI argument parsing
- [x] Create src/storage.js for JSON file operations
- [x] Implement `add` command (add new task)
- [x] Implement `list` command (show all tasks)
- [x] Create tasks.json storage file
- [x] Add basic error handling

**Expected files:**
- `src/task.js` - Main CLI entry point ✅
- `src/storage.js` - JSON read/write operations ✅
- `tasks.json` - Task storage (empty array initially) ✅

**Expected behavior:**
```bash
node src/task.js add "Buy groceries"
# Output: ✅ Task added: #1 "Buy groceries"

node src/task.js list
# Output:
# 📋 Your Tasks:
#  [1] [ ] Buy groceries
```

**Memory validation:**
- First task, no predictions
- Codebase map built
- Pattern created: "CLI command"

**Status:** ✅ **COMPLETED** - All functionality working as expected including:
- ✅ Basic add command with task description
- ✅ Priority levels (low, medium, high) with --priority flag
- ✅ Due dates with --due flag
- ✅ Categories with --category flag
- ✅ Input validation (empty descriptions, whitespace-only)
- ✅ List command with filters and sorting
- ✅ Color-coded output
- ✅ JSON persistence

---

### Task 2: Complete & Delete Operations
- [x] Implement `done` command (mark task complete)
- [x] Implement `delete` command (remove task)
- [x] Update storage.js to handle modifications
- [x] Add task status tracking (pending/completed)
- [x] Add colored output (green for completed, white for pending)

**Expected files:**
- Update `src/task.js` with new commands ✅
- Update `src/storage.js` with update/delete methods ✅

**Expected behavior:**
```bash
node src/task.js done 1
# Output: ✅ Task #1 marked as complete

node src/task.js delete 2
# Output: 🗑️  Task #2 deleted
```

**Memory validation:**
- Pattern match with Task 1 (~30-50% confidence)
- Suggests: `src/task.js`, `src/storage.js`
- Cache hits on reading existing files

**Status:** ✅ **COMPLETED** - Commands already implemented

---

### Task 3: Data Persistence & Validation
- [x] Ensure tasks persist across runs
- [x] Add input validation (empty tasks, invalid IDs)

- [x] Create tests for storage operations

**Expected files:**
- Update `src/storage.js` with validation ✅
- Update `src/task.js` with delete confirmation ✅
- Create `tests/storage.test.js`

**Expected behavior:**
```bash
node src/task.js add ""
# Output: ❌ Error: Task description cannot be empty

node src/task.js delete 999
# Output: ❌ Error: Task #999 not found

node src/task.js delete 123
# Output: 
# You are about to delete:
#   [123] Buy groceries
# Are you sure you want to delete this task? (y/n): y
# 🗑️  Task #123 deleted
```

**Memory validation:**
